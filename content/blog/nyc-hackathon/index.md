Adobe hosted an exciting and intense half-day Beman hackathon where we worked on
adding new Beman libraries, addressed infrastructure issues, and brainstormed
designs for the Beman website. It was awesome to collaborate in person. Here's
some of the awesome stuff that got accomplished:

- **New Beman tagline: "Tomorrow's C++ Standard Libraries Today"**. Thanks Nick
  DeMarco for this great contribution!
- **std::elide** paper implementation from Robert Leahy, a first time
  contributor!
- Linus Boehm made some great progress creating a
  [**std::indirect/std::polymorphic**](https://github.com/bemanproject/indirect/pull/1)
  Beman library.
- We had several discussions on the future of the
  [exemplar](https://github.com/bemanproject/exemplar) library.
- River Wu identified **root cause of an ASAN hanging issue**.
- Eddie Nolan and I sketched out a [rough
  design](https://www.ednolan.com/mockup.html) for the new website.

Overall it was productive and a ton of fun. Thanks to Robert, Eddie, Linus,
River, Nick, Bret, and Robert for participating!
