title: "For Library Users"

The Beman Project strives to be a distributor of a single-download library collection for C++ libraries proposed for standardization. Our goals are to provide stable distributions that match with the latest versions of C++ proposals.

Please note that it’s early days for the project so we’re still building our tooling and other details – please [join the discussion at our discourse](http://discourse.boost.org/).
