title: "For Library Authors"
---

Submission into the Beman Project is easy – [start a discussion on our discourse](http://discourse.boost.org/) and the welcome team will help get you started. A general precondition is an intent to submit a library for standardization. If you don’t have repository yet, or you want to upgrade to our standard we can help. Once your library is ready and has a paper, we’ll include it in the [Beman super project](http://github.com/bemanproject).

Please note that it’s early days for the project so we’re still building our tooling and other details.
