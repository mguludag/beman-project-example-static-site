title: "For Library Users"
---

The Beman Project’s mission is to support the efficient design and adoption of the highest quality C++ Standard libraries through implementation experience, user feedback, and technical expertise.

Founded at C++Now in 2024 the project strives to aggregate libraries proposed for ISO standardization making a simple usage experience [for the C++ Community](../users) to try out new libraries. [For library authors](../authors) we assist by helping to make best modern development practices easy. Including CI, coverage, and packaging.

This project is a completely volunteer effort. Please [connect with us on our discourse](http://discourse.boost.org/) if you’d like to help.
